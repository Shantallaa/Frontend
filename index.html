			<h3>We Believe</h3>
			<p>We believe fun is what makes for a better life. Everything we do starts with the goal of turning boring, routine activities into new ways of having fun.</p>
			<p>Fourdesire merges fun with technology and design to build sleek, data-driven apps. We use fun as a guide for developing our products, but we also believe that together we can use having fun to solve a number of the real-life problems people face every day.</p>
